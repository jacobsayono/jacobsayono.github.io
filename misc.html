          <p style="text-align: left;">I was inspired by <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-deep-learning-research-papers-to-code-f-f38bbd87352f" target="_blank">this blog</a> to learn how to implement research papers into code. I'm no way close to being an ML expert, but I believe this is the best way to start learning -- one step at a time by doing <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/" target="_blank">more examples</a> and to keep on trying. Here, we attempt to break down an algorithmic block or diagram, typically detailed in a research paper, into smaller functions and components of code.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">I'm so proud to finish the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) at UCLA! My arm was still healing and I was doing lots of physical therapy, but I managed to do the bare minimum to complete the SURP in a timely manner. Thank you to the NSF REU program for funding my research this summer. Go Bruins!</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">I experienced a spiral fracture on my right humerus bone during my spring break volunteering trip to Mongolia. It was a tough experience but I was still grateful and optimistic, receiving love and support while being surrounded by meaningful people. I had to go through surgery to place two titanium plates around the completely dislocated bone. I realized how we tend to take many things for granted, especially like a functional dominant arm. In the end, we were still able to cook for a family of 20 boys and it was such a memorable trip!</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">"Words are the children of reason and, therefore, can't explain it. They really can't translate feeling because they're not part of it. That's why it bugs me when people try to analyze jazz as an intellectual theorem. It's not. It's feeling." -Bill Evans.</p>
        <p>I play jazz lounge piano for weddings as a side gig; I hope to post some recordings soon!</p>
