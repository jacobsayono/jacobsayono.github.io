          <p style="text-align: left;">I was inspired by <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-deep-learning-research-papers-to-code-f-f38bbd87352f" target="_blank">this blog</a> to learn to implement research papers into code. There are many <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/" target="_blank">more examples</a> to try out of curiosity and self-interest. In this particular example, we attempt to break down an algorithmic block or diagram, typically detailed in a research paper, into smaller functions and components of code.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I find myself regularly referencing back to Russell/Norvig's AI textbook for refreshers, which include Python code implementation found <a href="https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python" target="blank">here</a>. Other recommended books on my reading list: Sutton/Barto's RL textbook, Christian's non-fiction book in aligning AI systems with human values, and Christian/Griffiths' book in applying algorithm principles to everyday life decisions.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">We shifted our product to be able to collect and sell our assets to existing delivery robot companies (Coco Delivery, Starship, Kiwibot). We also agreed to evenly distribute our final valuation to all contributing team members. The end goal is to eventually pass down the project to the future class who will continue this research space.
          BruinBot's current and future assets include: <br><br>

          1) Perception data that we collect on the field, which is used for model training and labeling <br>
          2) Decision making algorithms that drive any differential-drive robot autonomously in an ideal environment <br>
          3) Modular hardware designs and scalable circuit architectures for testing autonomy stacks <br>
          4) User interface platforms for tracking and controlling the multi-robot system <br>
          
          <br>
          We are currently collaborating with an engineering society (ASME at UCLA) to outsource hardware engineers to upgrade our physical prototype into a product-finish robot delivery service. Please check out our public code repository <a href="https://github.com/bruinbot" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">I am so happy to have completed the 2023 Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) at UCLA! My arm was still healing and I was doing lots of physical therapy, but I managed to do the bare minimum to complete the SURP in a timely manner. Thank you to the NSF REU program for funding my research this summer. Go Bruins!</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">I experienced a spiral fracture on my right humerus bone during my 2024 Spring Break volunteering trip to Mongolia. It was a tough experience but I was still grateful and optimistic, receiving love and support while being surrounded by meaningful people. I had to go through surgery to place two titanium plates around the completely dislocated bone. I realized how we tend to take many things for granted, especially like a functional dominant arm. In the end, we were still able to cook for a family of 20 boys and it was such a memorable trip! I also learned a lot of new recipes.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">"Words are the children of reason and, therefore, can't explain it. They really can't translate feeling because they're not part of it. That's why it bugs me when people try to analyze jazz as an intellectual theorem. It's not. It's feeling." -Bill Evans.

        I play jazz lounge piano for weddings as a side gig; I intend to share and post some recordings soon~!</p>
